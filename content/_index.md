# Workshop: Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SageMaker & DynamoDB

### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to build and deploy an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** on AWS.  
We will use **AWS Lambda** for preprocessing and inference, **API Gateway** to expose RESTful endpoints, **S3** for data storage, **Amazon SageMaker** for model training and hosting, **DynamoDB** for metadata storage, and **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand how to design and deploy a complete ML pipeline on AWS.  
- Build and configure data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training workflows.  
- Deploy and manage machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker.  
- Expose inference endpoints through API Gateway and Lambda.  
- Integrate DynamoDB for model metadata and use CloudWatch for monitoring.  
- Learn best practices for permissions, security, and cost optimization.

---

### ðŸ§° Requirements

- An existing AWS account (Free Tier: [https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free))  
- Basic knowledge of **Python** or **Go** (for Lambda functions and ML scripts)  
- Familiarity with **REST APIs** and **JSON**  
- Tools: **AWS CLI**, **Git**, **Docker** (optional), and a web browser  
- *(Optional)* **Postman** for testing inference endpoints

> ðŸ’¡ If you already have an AWS account with full access, you can skip IAM setup and continue directly to building resources.
