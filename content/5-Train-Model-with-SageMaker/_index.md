In this section, we will **train a machine learning model** with Amazon SageMaker using preprocessed data from Lambda and stored on S3. This is an important step to create a model that is ready to serve inference via API later.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Learn how to create a **SageMaker Training Job** from processed data.

- Configure training parameters and choose algorithms.

- Register the model (Model Registry) for later deployment.

- Manage model versions and track training progress.

## ðŸ§  Architecture overview

![SageMaker-Training-Architecture](/images/5.0.png)

1. **Lambda** creates processed data and saves it to the `processed/` folder on S3.

2. **SageMaker** reads data from S3, trains the model using the algorithm of your choice.

3. The resulting model is stored in `model/` and can be registered in the **Model Registry**.

4. The registered model will be used to deploy inference in the next step.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Completed **Lambda Preprocessing Function** (Chapter 4).

- Has processed data in the `processed/` folder of the S3 bucket.

- SageMaker IAM Role with access to **S3**, **CloudWatch**, and **SageMaker**.
