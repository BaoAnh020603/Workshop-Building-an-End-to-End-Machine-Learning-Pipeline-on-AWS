#### DynamoDB & CloudWatch in ML Pipeline

In the final step of the pipeline, we will **integrate Amazon DynamoDB** to store metadata of inference requests and model information, and use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor logs, measure performance, and generate alerts when problems occur.

This is an important step to ensure the pipeline can operate sustainably in a real environment.

#### 🗃️ DynamoDB – Storing metadata inference

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a high-performance, auto-scalable, serverless NoSQL database. In this project, DynamoDB will be used to:
- Store **inference results** from Lambda (input, output, time).
- Save **model information** such as version, endpoint name.
- Serve **performance monitoring and analysis** later.

---

#### 📊 CloudWatch – Pipeline monitoring and analysis

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a central monitoring service on AWS.
It will help you:
- Monitor **logs from Lambda and SageMaker Endpoint**.
- Create **metric filters** to analyze the number of inferences, errors, and delays.
- Configure **alarm** when the pipeline has problems.

📌 **Summary**

- ✅ You will learn how to create and manage a DynamoDB table to store inference results.
- ✅ Lambda will be extended to write data each time a prediction is made.
- ✅ CloudWatch will help you monitor logs, analyze performance, and create alerts.

🎯 **Outcomes after this chapter:**

- A complete ML pipeline capable of **historical inference**, **automatic monitoring**, and **early warning** when problems occur.

- Ready to operate in **production** environments with easy scalability and maintenance.
